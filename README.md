# Oasis Infobyte Internship Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing the projects I've completed during my 4-week internship with Oasis Infobyte. This experience has been instrumental in enhancing my practical knowledge of Python programming, and I'm excited to share the outcomes with you.

## Project Details

### BMI Calculator - Project 2
The **BMI Calculator** is a user-friendly Python application that prompts users to enter their weight in kilograms and height in meters. Upon input, it calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) and outputs the user's health status as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese, based on established medical standards.

### Random Password Generator - Project 3
Security is paramount, and the **Random Password Generator** addresses this by enabling users to create robust passwords. Users can specify their desired password length, and the app generates a complex password to meet their security needs. The app also offers the flexibility to regenerate the password multiple times until the user is satisfied with the outcome.

### Basic Weather Application - Project 4
The **Basic Weather Application** is a testament to the power of APIs in modern software development. By entering a city name, users receive a detailed report on the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a concise weather description. This app provides a real-time, easy-to-use interface for weather forecasting.

## Technologies and Tools
